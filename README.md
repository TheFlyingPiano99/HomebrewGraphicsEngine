# GPU volume-rendering


## How to run

The application runs on Microsoft Windows operation systems.
You can run by clicking the executable.

You can start from command line;
This way you can specify the foldername of the volume data:

`x64/Release/HomebrewGraphicsEngine.exe <folder name>`

The folder must be placed under `<project directory>/Resources/Textures/`

It must contain the slice images of the volume named like `###.tif` and a `dimensions.txt` file.

The `dimensions.txt` file must have the following content:

`name = <name of the dataset>`

`width = <int>`

`height = <int>`

`depth = <int>`

`bytesPerVoxel = <int>`

`widthScale = <float>`

`heightScale = <float>`

`depthScale = <float>`


We provide you some sample dataset:

`cthead-8bit`
